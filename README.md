#### 🦎 Geko
... is a friendly, lightweight programming language for math and games

#### 💡 Status
`Geko` is unstable, and currently a **work in progress project (WIP)**.  
Nightly builds are available giving you a chance to explore and test the language as it evolves.

#### 🏠 Quick Start
```geko
println("Hello, world!");
```

#### ✨ Examples
```geko
fun greet(name) {
  greetings := [
    "Nice to meet you",
    "Welcome aboard",
    "Glad you're here",
    "Hey"
  ]

  greeting := greetings.choice()
  putln(greeting + ", " + name, " 🎉!")
}

putln("👋 Hey there! What's your name?")
greet(readln())
```

```geko
class Sandwich {
  fun init(self, cheese, tomatoes) {
    self.cheese := cheese
    self.tomatoes := tomatoes
  }

  fun cook(self) {
    putln(
      "Sandwich is ready with "
      + str_of(self.cheese) + " cheese, "
      + str_of(self.tomatoes) + " tomatoes."
    )
  }
}

sandwich := Sandwich(3, 2)
sandwich.cook()
```
